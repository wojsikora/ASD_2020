""" 
Given two arrays X[] and Y[] of positive integers, find number of pairs such that x^y > y^x where x is an element from X[] and y is an element from Y[].
 """


""" 

NOT MINE!!!
The problem can be solved in O(nLogn + mLogn) time. The trick here is, if y > x then x^y > y^x with some exceptions.

Following are simple steps based on this trick.



Sort array Y[].
For every x in X[], find the index idx of smallest number greater than x (also called ceil of x) in Y[] using binary search or we can use the inbuilt function upper_bound() in algorithm library.
All the numbers after idx Base Cases and Exceptions:
Following are exceptions for x from X[] and y from Y[]

If x = 0, then the count of pairs for this x is 0.
If x = 1, then the count of pairs for this x is equal to count of 0s in Y[].
x smaller than y means x^y is greater than y^x.
x = 2, y = 3 or 4
x = 3, y = 2
Note that the case where x = 4 and y = 2 is not theresatisfy the relation so just add (n-idx) to the count.
